**METHODOLOGY**
* The Steps to Develop a Chatbot
  1. Crawl data from any website to collect information (e.g., https://www.presight.io/privacy-policy.html).
  2. Perform preprocessing for NLP.
  3. Convert the data into vectors (Embedding).
  4. Receive the question input from the user interface.
  5. Preprocess and embed the question input.
  6. Find matching vectors: To improve the model's performance and accuracy, we retrieve the top 3 vectors with the highest scores instead of just the top 1.
  7. Use the high-scoring vectors to identify the corresponding passages they represent.
  8. Map the identified passages to larger text segments to ensure sufficient context and information are provided.
  9. Input the mapped passages into the Gemini API or a similar LLM to process and generate accurate, natural responses.
  10. Output the generated response from the LLM to the user interface.

**REFLECTION**
* Achievements: Successfully developed a chatbot capable of delivering results with up to 95% accuracy.
* Limitations: Insufficient attention and development on the chatbot's front-end interface.
